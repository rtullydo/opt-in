## Credit

This website was created by [Ryan Tully-Doyle][4], [Kelly Bickel][5], and [J. E. Pascoe][3]. The original idea was inspired by the "Widening the Pipeline" conversation at "2TART hosts: OTWIA" online conference. The Directory was inspired by the work of the [Operator Algebra Searchable Information Site][1]. The idea for the Curriculum was inspired by Brett Wick's [Internet Analysis Seminar][2].
