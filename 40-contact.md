## Credit

This website was created by [Ryan Tully-Doyle][4], [Kelly Bickel][5], and [J. E. Pascoe][3]. The original idea was inspired by the "Widening the Pipeline" conversation at [2TART Presents: OTWIA][6] online conference. The Directory was inspired by the impressive and comprehensive [Operator Algebra Searchable Information Site][1]. The idea for the Curriculum was inspired by Brett Wick's [Internet Analysis Seminar][2].
