# So you want to do operator theory (testing layout)

#### Getting started

- Take linear algebra

- Take more linear algebra

- Take as much complex analysis as possible

- Read or use Sheldon Axler's _Linear Algebra Done Right_

	- <http://linear.axler.net> A complete video lecture series by Sheldon Axler and other resources

- Follow up with Nicholas Young's _Introduction to Hilbert Space_

	- [Hilbert Space: a sequel to linear algebra][1] in progress online adaptation of Introduction to Hilbert Space by Ryan Tully-Doyle

#### Graduate school

- Ideally, you'll take a year each of real, complex, and functional analysis

- You want to take a matrix theory course if possible
 
- Consider matrix theory, probability, and abstract algebra
