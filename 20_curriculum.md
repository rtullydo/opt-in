# So you want to do operator theory (testing layout)

#### Getting started

- Take as much linear algebra as possibe

	- Horn and Garcia's _A Second Course in Linear ALgebra_

	- Sergei Treil's [Linear Algebra Done Wrong][2] 

- Take as much complex analysis as possible

	- Donald Sarason's _Complex Function Theory_ is a short and self-contained one semester introduction

	- [A First Course in Complex Analysis][3] by Beck, Marchesi, Pixton, and Sabalka

- Read Sheldon Axler's _Linear Algebra Done Right_ if you didn't use it for your second linear algebra course

	- <http://linear.axler.net> A complete video lecture series by Sheldon Axler and other resources

- Follow up with Nicholas Young's _Introduction to Hilbert Space_

	- [Hilbert Space: a sequel to linear algebra][1] online text adapted from and inspired by _Introduction to Hilbert Space_ by Ryan Tully-Doyle

#### Graduate school

- Ideally, you'll take a year each of real, complex, and functional analysis

- You want to take a matrix theory course if possible
 
- Consider matrix theory, probability, and abstract algebra
