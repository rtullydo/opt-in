### Title:

Dilations and Matrix Ranges of Unitary Tuples

### Abstract:

We define three distance functions on the space of $$d$$-tuples of unitary operators on a Hilbert space related to dilations, matrix ranges, and representations, respectively. For any of those distance functions, two $$d$$-tuples $$U$$ and $$V$$ have zero distance if and only if there is a $$*$$-isomorphism between the generated $$C^*$$-algebras which maps every entry of U to the corresponding entry of $$V$$, in which case we consider $$U$$ and $$V$$ as equivalent. We establish estimates between the considered distance functions, and conclude that those distance functions give rise to equivalent metrics on a large subspace of all unitary $$d$$-tuples (up to equivalence).

As an example, we consider the rotation $$C^*$$-algebras, i.e., the universal $$C^*$$-algebras generated by a pair of unitaries $$(u, v)$$ subject to the relation $$vu=quv$$ for a complex number $$q$$ of modulus 1. Based on estimates for the "dilation distance" between pairs of generators, we find a new and rather simple proof of the fact (and certain refinements thereof) that the rotation $$C^*$$-algebras form a continuous field.
