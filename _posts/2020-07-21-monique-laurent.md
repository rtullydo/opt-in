### Title:

 Convergence Analysis of Approximation Hierarchies for Polynomial Optimization

### Abstract:

Minimizing a polynomial function f over a compact set $$K$$ is a computationally hard problem. Upper bounds have been introduced by Lasserre (2011), which are obtained by searching for a degree $$2r$$ sum-of-squares density function minimizing the expected value of $$f$$ over $$K$$ with respect to a given reference measure supported by $$K$$.
We will discuss several techniques that permit to analyse the performance guarantee of these bounds. This includes an eigenvalue reformulation of the bounds, links to extremal roots of orthogonal polynomials and to cubature rules, and reducing to the univariate case by means of push-forward measures.
For simple sets $$K$$ like the box, the unit ball, the simplex and the unit sphere one can show that the convergence rate to the global minimum is in $$O(1/r^2)$$ and that this bound is tight for some classes of polynomials and, for general convex bodies, one can show a slightly weaker convergence rate in $$O((log(r)/r)^2)$$.
