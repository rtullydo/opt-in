### Speaker: 
Raymond Cheng, Old Dominion University

### Title: 
Function theory and $$l^p_A$$.

### Abstract:
$$l^p_A$$ is the space of analytic functions on the open unit disk whose Taylor coefficients belong to the familiar sequence space $$l^p$$.  Despite its simple definition and classical origins, surprisingly little is known about this space, except when $$p=1$$ or $$2$$.  We'll do a non-technical survey of what is known or not known, mostly in comparison with the Hardy spaces, touching on zero sets, boundary behavior, factorization, shift-invariant subspaces, and multipliers.
