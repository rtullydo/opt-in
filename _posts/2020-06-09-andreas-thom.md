### Title:

Asymptotics of Cheeger constants and unitarisability of groups

### Abstract:

 Given a group $$\Gamma$$, we establish a connection between the unitarisability of its uniformly bounded representations and the asymptotic behaviour of the isoperimetric constants of Cayley graphs of $$\Gamma$$ for increasingly large generating sets.

The connection hinges on an analytic invariant $$\operatorname{Lit}(\Gamma) \in [0,\infty]$$ which we call the Littlewood exponent. Finiteness, amenability, unitarisability and the existence of free subgroups are related respectively to the thresholds 0,1,2 and $$\infty$$ for $$\operatorname{Lit}(\Gamma)$$. Using graphical small cancellation theory, we prove that there exist groups $$\Gamma$$ for which $$1 \lt \operatorname{Lit}(\Gamma)<\infty$$. Further applications, examples and problems are discussed.
