### Title:

One-dimensional scaling limits in a Laplacian random growth model

### Abstract:

Conformal maps in the complex plane can be used to encode several types of aggregation processes that arise in mathematical physics. Simulations of these conformal aggregation models produce intriguing pictures hinting at rich and perhaps fractal structures in the resulting clusters, but for the most part these processes have resisted rigorous analysis.

In my talk I will discuss an instance where a rigorous analysis is possible: if the self-reinforcement in the growth local rule is strong enough, then the natural scaling limits of the growing clusters collapse into one-dimensional structures, in contrast to the weak reinforcement regime where growth is uniformly spread out.

This reports on joint work with Amanda Turner (Lancaster University/University of Geneva) and Fredrik Viklund (KTH).
