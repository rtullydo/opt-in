### Title: 
Noncommutative $C^k$ Functions, Multiple Operator Integrals, and Derivatives of Operator Functions

### Abstract:
Abstract: Let $$\mathcal{A}$$ be a $$C^\ast$$-algebra, $$f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$$ be a continuous function, and $$\tilde{f} \colon \mathcal{A}_{\text{sa}} \to \mathcal{A}$$ be the functional calculus map $$\mathcal{A}_{\text{sa}} \ni a \mapsto f(a) \in \mathcal{A}$$. It is elementary to show that $$\tilde{f}$$ is continuous, so it is natural to wonder how the differentiability properties of $$f$$ relate/transfer to those of $$\tilde{f}$$. This turns out to be a delicate, complicated problem. In this talk, I introduce a rich class $$NC^k(\mathbb{R}) \subseteq C^k(\mathbb{R})$$ of \textit{noncommutative} $$C^k$$ functions $$f$$ such that $$\tilde{f}$$ is $$k$$-times differentiable. I shall also discuss the interesting objects, called \textit{multiple operator integrals}, used to express the derivatives of $$\tilde{f}$$.
