### Title: 
A different approach to endpoint weak-type estimates for Calder贸n-Zygmund operators

### Abstract:
The weak-type (1,1) estimate for Calder贸n-Zygmund operators is fundamental in harmonic analysis. We investigate weak-type inequalities for Calder贸n-Zygmund singular integral operators using the Calder贸n-Zygmund decomposition and ideas inspired by Nazarov, Treil, and Volberg. We discuss applications of these techniques in the Euclidean setting, in weighted settings, for multilinear operators, for operators with weakened smoothness assumptions, and in studying the dimensional dependence of the Riesz transforms.
