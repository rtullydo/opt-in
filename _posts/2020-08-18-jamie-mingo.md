### Title:

Infinitesimal Freeness and Non-commutative Functions

### Abstract:

The basic tool in free probability is the $$R$$-transform. It connects the moments and the free cumulants of a random variable through a functional equation of analytic functions. Infinitesimal freeness is finer type of independence used to analyze spike models in random matrix theory. I will show how the non-commutative functions can be used to find the functional relations for infinitesimal freeness. This is joint work with Pei-Lun Tseng.
