### Title:

Quantum Symmetries of Quantum Metric Spaces

### Abstract:

 I will first give a light introduction to the theory of compact quantum groups. We will then look at Weaver and Kuperberg's quantum metric spaces, which are a non-commutative analogue of finite metric spaces. Banica has defined the quantum symmetry group of a finite metric space, and I will talk about how to capture Banica's definition using the Weaver-Kupperberg framework of quantum metric spaces.
