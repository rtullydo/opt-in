### Title:

Quantitative Diagonalizability

### Abstract:

A diagonalizable matrix has linearly independent eigenvectors. Since the set of nondiagonalizable matrices has measure zero, every matrix is a limit of diagonalizable matrices. We prove a
quantitative version of this fact: every $$n \times n$$ complex matrix is within distance delta in the operator norm of a matrix whose eigenvectors have condition number poly(n)/delta, confirming a conjecture of E. B. Davies. The proof is based adding a complex Gaussian perturbation to the matrix and studying its pseudospectrum.

Finally, we mention a recent application of this result to numerical analysis, yielding the fastest known provable algorithm for diagonalizing an arbitrary matrix.
