#### Title
Common range of co-analytic Toeplitz operators in the Drury--Arveson space

#### Abstract
A theorem of McCarthy describes the space of all functions in the Hardy
space on the unit disc belonging to the range of every co-analytic
Toeplitz operator. This space is intimately related to the classical
Smirnov class on the unit disc. In multivariable operator theory, the
appropriate generalization of the classical Hardy space is often thought
to be the Drury--Arveson space $$H^2_d$$ on the unit ball in $$\mathbb C^d$$.

I will talk about a generalization of McCarthy's theorem to the
Drury--Arveson space. In particular, this involves understanding
appropriate analogues of the Smirnov class in this setting. This is
joint work with Alexandru Aleman, John McCarthy and Stefan Richter.
