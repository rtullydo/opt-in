### Title:

New Hilbert Space methods in Dynamic Mode Decomposition

### Abstract:

 In this talk we will discuss new methods for performing Dynamic Mode Decompositions (DMD) on time series data. These methods utilize the concept of occupation kernels and their interactions with the Liouville operator  (also known as the Koopman Generator). We introduce a generalization of the Liouville operator, the "scaled" Liouville operator, that allows for operator norm convergence of DMD procedures.

This talk will outline the theoretical benefits from this new perspective, which allows for the analysis of a broader classes of continuous time dynamics than DMD methods based on the Koopman (composition) operators and stronger convergence results.

This talk will serve as a practice run for a talk at a workshop hosted by the American Control Conference that I'm organizing with Dr. Rushikesh Kamalapurkar which will run on June 30th.
