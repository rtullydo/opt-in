## Title:

Jensen’s Inequality for separately convex noncommutative functions

## Abstract:

I’ll give a brief introduction to noncommutative (AKA “matrix”) convexity, and a sampling of how classical theorems in convexity seem to always have matricial analogues. Classically, Jensen’s Inequality asserts that if $$f$$ is a convex function and $$\mu$$ is a probability measure, then $$\int f\; d\mu$$ is at least as big as the evaluation of $$f$$ at the “average point” or barycenter of $$\mu$$. Noncommutative convex functions satisfy a Jensen Inequality for any unital completely positive (ucp) map, which plays the role of a noncommutative measure. I’ll show how the much broader class of noncommutative multivariable functions which are convex in each variable separately satisfy Jensen’s Inequality for certain “free product” ucp maps. It turns out such ucp maps show up naturally in free probability, and we’ll see a sample application yielding operator inequalities for free semicircular systems.
